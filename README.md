# Technical Debt Insights from the Lorax

Technical debt is a common analogy to describe the cost of code mess and poor architecture. However, how far can the monetary analogy go? In this session we will look at insights from the Lorax and “environmental debt”. Specifically, we will build an argument for why the monetary comparison communicates the wrong idea about how technical debt is measured and how it impacts business. We will conclude with identifying measures and practices to mitigate technical debt.

This session might be for you if you deal with the challenge of communicating the business cost of technical debt, you want a clearer understanding of what technical debt is and how to measure it, or you want advice on how to mitigate against technical debt.

The key takeaway from this session will be an improved strategy for identifying, measuring, preventing, and communicating technical debt.
