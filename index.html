                        Learn testing strategies.
                        Establish testing strategies / objectives up from and iterate over them. Tests aren’t always relevant over the course of the full project.

                    Build refactor time into your development cycle: “An excellent time to refactor code is right before you extend it.” http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TechnicalDebt 
                        Note: this refactor time should include audit of architecture, of testing strategy, of CI tools, basically improve anything that helps mitigate against tech debt
                        (consider production vs production capacity image with the goose that lays golden eggs; this is from a book…)

                    Build a culture that doesn’t transfer business pressures to the development cycle.
                        this is where a good project manager buffers: only let the important things through (implication: you have to know what is important to communicate)
                        tech lead != product owner: the one deciding what is important to the business should not also be the one who knows how it is built; you need someone who can write down the business requirements--THIS IS THE POWA OF BEHAVIORAL TESTING!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Gerkin ftw!!
