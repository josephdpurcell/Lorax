                                <li>Point: The monetary analogy communicates the wrong idea about how technical debt is measured and how it impacts business.</li>
                                <li>Why is it a problem to compare tech to money?</li>
                                <li>Money is a common exchange of value; translation code is a common exchange of effort</li>
                                <li>Logical conclusions for a business person:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>tech debt = LOC per person per hour * # of persons</li>
                                        <li>If I know how much effort per line of code I know the cost.</li>
                                        <li>I should be able to ask questions like:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Where is the technical debt?</li>
                                                <li>How much do we owe?</li>
                                                <li>How much is it costing us in interest repayments?</li>
                                                <li>How long will it take to repay?</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>These are easy questions in the financial world because we have bank statements and balance sheets readily available to quantify monetary debt, and there is an exact tradeoff between spending income on debt versus new assets.</li>
                                <li>In the tech world, we are still defining what good code is and there are contextual nuances that prevent consensus.</li>
                                <li>When pitting working on tech debt versus new features, clients expect to know the cost-benefit analysis, because it must compare to money.</li>
                                <li>Monetary debt is discrete and quantifiable, whereas technical debt is connected and qualitative.</li>
                                <li>It's ok to default on tech debt, but not money. (<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/11/technical-debt-when-metaphors-go-wrong.html">source</a>)</li>
                                <li>Monetary debt has a schedule for repayment, but not tech debt. (<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/11/technical-debt-when-metaphors-go-wrong.html">source</a>)</li>
